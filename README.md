# Flutter CI/CD Testing

Just a flutter project to test CI/CD to Android & iOS

## Notes

A few resources to look at:

- [Flutter action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flutter-action) - GitHub Action for building flutter projects
- [About GitHub runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners)
- [GitHub actions billing](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions) - it appears MacOS now just cost's 10x a linux runner and can now use the free 2,000 Minutes per Month (equivilent to 200 Minues on MacOS)
